# bevy_blood_oath

This project was suppose to be a port of https://github.com/amethyst/rustrogueliketutorial. I ported a good bit of the book and learned a good bit about bevy.

I am closing the project, since I have a good bit of projects open, and plan to utilize the actual bevy engine to do my game development!
